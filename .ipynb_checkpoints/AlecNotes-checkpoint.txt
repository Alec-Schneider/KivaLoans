kiva_loans.csv
1. Converting columns to appropriate dtype:
    - To datetime:
        - posted_time
        - disbursed_time
        - funded_time - need to fill in null values to handle loans that were not fully funded
        - date
 2. Columns with null values:
     - use
         - fill in with '' since all others are contain a description
         - Use and borrower_genders are always null together
     - country_code
         - Nambia does not have a country code, fill with 'NB' as that code is not currently in the data
     - region
         - fill in region with most popular region in the country?
     - partner_id
         - fill in with 0 to signify no partner? going to be one hot encoded anyway
     - disbursed_time
         - why were there loans that were not disbursed? Should we drop them? There are loans that were fully funded and not disbursed.
         - if not fill in with pd.to_datetime(0) to default to 1970-01-01
     - funded_time - means that a funded_amount never got to loan_amount (Need to fill in before converting to datetime)
         - fill in with pd.to_datetime(0) to default to 1970-01-01
     - tags - they did not add tags when filling out application?
         - fill in with '' since there were no tags added to application?
     - borrow_genders
         - fill in with '' to signify none
         
3. Feature Engineering:
    - time_til_funded
        - funded_time - posted_time
        - need to first check if a loan was even fully funded
    - borrower_count
        - number of borrowers in borrow_genders
    - female_pct
        - pct of female borrowers in borrow_genders
    - male_pct
        - pct of male borrowers in borrow_genders
    - posted_time_day
        - day of the week that the loan application was posted
    - posted_time_hour
        - hour of the day that the loan application was posted
    - len_of_use
        - number of words in use
    - len_of_tags
        - number of tags in tags
    - Numerical Features:
        - lender_count
        - loan_amount
        - term_in_months
    - One Hot Endcoding:
        - activity
        - currency
        - sector
        - repayment_interval
        - country
        - partner_id
    - Ordinal Encoding

4. Features to drop for training?:
    - id
    - posted_time?
    - fundeded_amount
    - country_code or country?
    - tags
    - use
    - borrow_genders
    - region?
    - disbursed_time
    - 
    
5. Target:
    - This is going to to have to be a piecewise function like so:
        1. Was the loan fully funded?
            a. Use a sigmoid function, RandomForestClassifier or XGBClassifier to first classify if the the loan is funded. 
            b. No, predict the % of loan_amount was actually funded
                 - find the features that have a strong association with funding most of the loan_amount
            c. Yes, then how fast was the loan funded
                 - Find the features that minimize the time to funding gyuu
